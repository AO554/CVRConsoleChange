# CVRConsoleChange
Pretty simple on the tin, Change the MelonLoader Console Title for ChilloutVR!
(Yes I know its simple to do, give me a break I finally started doing development stuff)

Version: ``1.0.0``

- Settings are configurable in your MelonPreferences
- Togglable

Should mention there is a Universal Version to which is much better than this Project [Found Here!](https://github.com/MintLily/ConsoleTitleHider)
